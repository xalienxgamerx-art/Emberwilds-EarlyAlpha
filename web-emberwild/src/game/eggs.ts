/**
 * Carried eggs — stolen eggs as living cargo.
 *
 * Stealing a nest egg captures its ChildBlueprint (species, genes, mutations,
 * personality, skills, parentage, lineage), so the unborn creature's whole
 * inheritance rides with the shell. The egg incubates over a species-dependent
 * span (big bodies take longer, mirroring how they grow up slower), then the
 * game prompts: keep — the hatchling is tamed through the exact bred-baby birth
 * path — or release it to live on as a wild, persistent individual. Eggs are
 * food only by choice: they live outside the bag, so every bag-scanning feeder
 * skips them.
